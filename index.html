        <h1> What I learned about Visual Studios </h1>
        <p> To set it up you have to download the app and install Live Server. Then add a folder and go to visual studios. Finally go to Visual Studios and click on File> Open Folder and find the folder you made. </p>
        <br>
        <p> The console screen is a screen that shows you the code that you made. It is used to show what is happening in your code. </p>
        <p> From your Visual Studios you have to right click on your file and press Open with Live-Server. Then you right click on your output page and click on inspect and then console. </p>
        <br>
        <p> To print something on the console screen you have to put console.log and type in whatever variable you want after it. </p>
        <script>
            var first_name="Akshara";
            var last_name="Appadwedula";
            var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);
            var squareroot=Math.sqrt(734);
            console.log(squareroot);
            var greater_than=Math.max(18347,18253);
            console.log(greater_than);
